Here is some precalculated statistics of tree-of-life graph, files in this directory contains:

`allCyclesUpTo10reactions.csv.7z` - all reactions from cyles of length 10 and less. Each line contains reaction smiles and name. The file contains cycles from 2 to 10 reactions so each line (row) has from 4 to 20 columns.
This file is compressed with p7zip, after decompression it has 270MB.

`cycles.csv` - statistics of cycles length

`preferentialattachemt_5_6gen-cmdUpto5gen.csv` - growth of node connectivity between generation 5 and 6 for all compounds up to 5th generation 

`preferentialattachemt_5_7gen-cmdUpto5gen.csv` - growth of node connectivity between generation 5 and 7 for all compounds up to 5th generation 

`preferentialattachemt_5_6gen-cmdUpto4gen.csv` - growth of node connectivity between generation 5 and 6 for all compounds up to 4th generation   

`preferentialattachemt_5_7gen-cmdUpto4gen.csv` - growth of node connectivity between generation 5 and 7 for all compounds up to 4th generation 

`KinKout-after5th_generation.csv` - Kin and Kout for tree-of-life after 5th generation

`KinKout-after6th_generation.csv` - Kin and Kout for tree-of-life after 6th generation

`KinKout-after7th_generation.csv` - Kin and Kout for tree-of-life after 7th generation

`cyclesSimilarityndDiversity.csv` - number of cycles of given length, number of all and unique compounds in cycles, similarity and diversity for small cycles (up to 11 reactions)

You can do this (and much more) by your own using data from /data directory. See also /script directory for example how to work with the data.
