Here is some precalculated statistics of tree-of-life graph, files in this directory contains:

`cycles.csv` - statistics of cycles length
`preferentialattachemt_5_6gen-cmdUpto5gen.csv` - growth of node connectivity between generation 5 and 6 for all compounds up to 5th generation 
`preferentialattachemt_5_7gen-cmdUpto5gen.csv` - growth of node connectivity between generation 5 and 7 for all compounds up to 5th generation 
`preferentialattachemt_5_6gen-cmdUpto4gen.csv` - growth of node connectivity between generation 5 and 6 for all compounds up to 4th generation   
`preferentialattachemt_5_7gen-cmdUpto4gen.csv` - growth of node connectivity between generation 5 and 7 for all compounds up to 4th generation 

You can do this (and much more) by your own using data from /data directory. See also /script directory for example how to work with the data.
